[WOTC] Iridar's Vanilla Classes Redux [BETA]

This mod is a collection of bugfixes and balancing improvements for the four base game classes, three WOTC faction hero classes and SPARKs.

Most classes had their ability trees rearranged. Holes in the faction heroes' ability trees are plugged with cut content abilities or their XCOM row abilities that are critical for certain playstyles. The pool of available cross-class perks has also been expanded, especially for faction heroes. Many abilities had their descriptions improved for clarity.

It is intended as the go-to mod for fixing all the various issues with vanilla classes, without the need to collect dozens of mods that individually fix small issues. It integrates fixes from a lot of existing mods, making them incompatible or redundant.

In general, the purpose of this mod is to make vanilla classes more fun, very few things have been nerfed.

[h1]BETA STATUS[/h1]

The mod is fresh out of the oven, and has not been playtested extensively. There could be bugs. If you encounter any issues, please comment about them below.

[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]

The mod is obviously incompatible with LWOTC and other mods that completely replace vanilla classes with new ones. Mods that tweak the same abilities as this mod may also be incompatible, though at worst some soldier abilities won't work right, you shouldn't experience crashes or other gamebreaking issues.

[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]

If necessary, changes to each class can be disabled in the config by deleting the respective class' folder. Some aspects of the changed abilities are also configurable.

-------------------------------------------------

[h1]RANGER[/h1]

Vanilla Rangers are already in the great state, but are completely outclassed by Reapers for purposes of scouting. This mod somewhat remedies the situation, and buffs some of the least used abilities. 

I consider Blademaster, Bladestorm and Implacable to be must have abilities for a melee ranger, so I put all of them into the Assault specialization. Both Implacable and Run and Gun are powerful perks, so they're now on the same rank. Deep Cover and Conceal share the same theme of being hard to get, so they're on the same rank. Bladestorm and Untouchable are both powerful perks, so they're on the same rank. 

Overall, you get two clearly different specializations/playstyles: Assault is all about offensive use of the sword. Deep Cover can help get into the position under fire, but Conceal is also a viable pick on the same rank. 

Meanwile, Scout is still the poor man's Reaper, but with its own identity of waiting for the right moment, and then bashing the door in for 1-2 (3 with the consumable concealment item) powerful turns per mission.

Overall, Assault is obviously much stronger, but there's only so much I can do without completely overhauling the class.

[list]
[*] Ability tree rearranged. 
[*] Phantom now additionally reduces detection range in concealment by 50%.
[*] Shadowstrike now actually applies its bonus while concealed instead of against enemies that can't see the Ranger. The bonus is now also provided for the entire turn the concealment was broken, and is now applied to melee attacks in a transparent manner.
[*] Conceal - updated description to mention it can't be used while flanked.
[*] Untouchable - added a flyover and a buff chevron when the Untouchable bonus is gained. 
[*] Rapid Fire - now has a 4 turn cooldown (down from 5). Cooldown is now mentioned in the extended description.
[*] Deep Cover - now makes Hunker Down grant +2 Armor, if Hunker Down is used manually.
[/list]

[h1]SHARPSHOOTER[/h1]

Sharpshooters are functionally fine in vanilla for the most part, but their perk progression is awful. With my rework, key perks are given earlier, and there's a clear gameplay loop of proccing Death From Above, and then using that action point on Hunker Down to boost your accuracy with Aim. Both Aim and Death From Above now have proper interactions with pistol abilities, which should make the Sniper spec a bit more versatile. I also put Fan Fire earlier in the tree and on the same rank as Deadeye, as both are high damage single target abilities, and Faceoff and Serial are also on the same rank now, which makes way more sense to me than the vanilla layout.

[list]
[*] Ability tree rearranged.
[*] Squadsight - removed hidden crit chance penalty.
[*] Return Fire - now preemptive and ignores cover defense bonus.
[*] Deadeye - aim penalty is now flat -20 Aim and damage boost now applies to the total attack's damage.
[*] Death From Above - now triggers once per turn and works with pistols. No more free Serial with Darklance.
[*] Aim - aim bonus now applies to all attacks made this turn.
[*] Serial - added -20 Crit penalty after each kill (vanilla description mentions a crit chance penalty, but it's not implemented in vanilla)
[*] Fan Fire - now ends turn.
[/list]

[h1]GRENADIER[/h1]

Grenadiers are changed the least by the rework. The biggest changes are buffs to Suppression and Demolition, the rest are mostly bugfixes.

[list]
[*] Blast Padding - now applies to environmental damage.
[*] Demolition - now a guaranteed hit and applies Holo Targeting.
[*] Suppression - now preemptively triggers on attacks, ignores cover defense bonus.
[*] Chain Shot - aim penalty moved from the first shot to the second one.
[*] Saturation Fire - now more reliable at destroying cover.
[*] Rupture - no longer usable while Disoriented.
[/list]

[h1]SPECIALIST[/h1]

Mostly bugfixes and consistency improvements. Notably, all Protocol abilities no longer end turn.

[list]
[*] Combat Protocol - no longer ends turn.
[*] Revival Protocol - bugfixes, charges changed to 1/2/3.
[*] Haywire Protocol - no longer ends turn.
[*] Scanning Protocol - unlocked camera while targeting. Charges changed to 1/2/3.
[*] Covering Fire - now ignores cover defense bonus.
[*] Threat Assessment - now properly works for Templars. Now also ignores cover defense bonus, but the Covering Fire effect is removed after taking one Overwatch shot.
[*] Ever Vigilant - using Reliable Ever Vigilant is recommended.
[*] Restoration - bugfixes.
[*] Capacitor Discharge - damage now ignores armor.
[/list]

[h1]REAPER[/h1]

Vanilla Reapers are already excellent, so this rework mostly just fills the holes in their ability tree and buffs some of the weaker abilities.

[list]
[*] Ability tree rearranged.
[*] Soul Harvest - increased Crit Chance boost per kill from 5 to 10 and max Crit Chance boost from 20 to 40. This lets you reach 100% crit at full stacks against flanked enemies if you use either upgraded Superior Laser Sight or Talon Ammo. Now can be triggered by Claymores, and apply to any attack that can crit, not just Vektor.
[*] Sting - now a guaranteed crit and has a 2 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission.
[*] Blood Trail - bonus damage now also applies to bleeding units, though there's no way to apply bleeding in this mod.
[*] Infiltration (GTS perk) - hacking bonus increased from 25 to 75.
[*] Squadsight, Tactical Rigging - now included into the main ability tree.
[*] New ability: Improvised Silencer - Remove the chance of being revealed on the first shot after entering Shadow.
[*] New ability: Shadow Rising - Shadow gains an additional charge.
[*] New Ability: Death Dealer - Critical shots against a flanked target while in Shadow will deal double critical damage.
[/list]

[h1]SKIRMISHER[/h1]

Skirmishers are considered by most to be the weakest faction hero class. Many of their abilities are either useless or broken, and many can be used only once per mission. Their Bullpups also have poor scaling. So the result is that they have essentially only one viable build, and even that falls off towards the late game significantly. This mod addresses all of that.

[list]
[*] Ability tree rearranged.
[*] Justice - fixed a visual bug that makes the enemy float in the air if it's pulled into high cover and then killed.
[*] Wrath and Justice - now have a special execution animation when killing humanoid enemies.
[*] Reckoning - no longer has a cooldown, but dash attacks (outside blue move range) consume more action points. Now has a proper icon.
[*] Reflex - now triggers once per turn instead of once per mission, and displays a debuff while it's on cooldown.
[*] Total Combat - now also grants a Grenade-only slot.
[*] Zero In - now works with melee attacks and grants +20 Crit per attack (up from +10).
[*] Whiplash - now has a 5 turn cooldown instead of one use per mission. Damage now scales with Ripjack tier, pierces armor and can crit. 
[*] Interrupt - now grants two actions and has a 3 turn cooldown instead of one use per mission. Multiple units can Interrupt together now.
[*] Combat Presence - can now be used during Interrupt and Battlelord.
[*] Full Throttle - Mobility bonus increased from 2 to 4 and now Full Throttle also reduces Grapple's current cooldown on kills.
[*] Waylay - now allows reaction attacks to crit.
[*] Battlelord - fixed bug that prevented it from triggering more than once. Multiple units can use Battlelord together now. Battlelord and Interrupt cannot be used at the same time. Now has 4 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission.
[*] Return Fire - now a part of the main ability tree. Now triggers preemptively (before the enemy attack) and ignores enemy's Cover defense.
[*] Lightning Reflexes, Tactical Rigging - now included into the main ability tree.
[*] Parkour (GTS perk) - new additional effect: using Grapple now grants a move-only action.
[*] Ripjacks - now have 10% innate chance to crit, same as swords.
[*] Bullpups - mag tier crit damage increased to 2, beam tier base damage increased from 6-7 to 7-8.
[*] New ability: Forward Operator -> immediately gain an extra action when a new group of enemies is revealed. Triggers once per turn.
[/list]

[h1]TEMPLAR[/h1]

A lot of people consider Templars without Bladestorm and Reaper to be second class citizens, so now they have both in their main tree. Many abilities were tweaked to make playstyles other than hurr-durr-Rend-24-7 viable.

[list]
[*] Ability tree rearranged.
[*] Rend - new icon.
[*] Volt - no longer ends turn.
[*] Parry - now is a defensive ability that cannot be interrupted.
[*] Aftershock - no longer stacks with itself.
[*] Overcharge - since it applies only to non-lethal Rend attacks, chance has been increased to 100%.
[*] Amplify - now consistently increases total attack damage.
[*] Deflect and Reflect - now have separate rolls, and both rolls happen before Parry. Reflected attack now uses Templar's Aim for hit chance instead of a flat chance and ignores target's cover Defense bonus.
[*] Exchange and Invert - Focus cost removed. Can be activated with regular and Momentum action points. Cooldown increased from 1 turn to 2. Exchange can no longer target turrets.
[*] Pillar - now a free action. Cast range limited to 18 tiles. Can no longer summon on tiles adjacent to units to avoid a bug with Pillar not granting cover in that circumstance. Remaining duration now displayed on the Templar as a buff.
[*] Stun Strike - now is a guaranteed hit and can be interrupted, and instead of disorientation stuns the target. Knockback is still not guaranteed.
[*] Void Conduit - new icon. Can be interrupted. Visualization hang resolved. Instead of dealing 3 damage when used and draining 2 HP per [b]action[/b] at the start of enemy turn, it drains 2 HP when used, and then 2 HP every [b]turn[/b] at the start of the player's turn. Now correctly disables the target for the number of turns equal to Templar's Focus when cast. Cooldown increased to 3 turns.
[*] Ghost - no longer ends turn, and has a 5 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission. Ghost now always has the same base HP as the Templar that summoned it. The confusing mechanic that made its HP scale with Focus is removed.
[*] Bladestorm - renamed to "Zeal" and is always present in the ability tree (no longer an XCOM row random perk). New icon.
[*] Reaper - always present in the ability tree (no longer an XCOM row random perk).
[/list]

[h1]SPARK[/h1]
[list]
[*] Bulwark - updated description to mention enemies receive cover too.
[*] Repair - amount repaired now scales with BIT tier. Cures acid and other stuff normally healed by Medikit, though SPARK is immune to it anyway.
[*] Bombard - now shreds 1/2/3 armor.
[*] Sacrifice - integrated Sacrifice Targeting Fix.
[/list]

[h1]ABILITY INTERRUPTION CHANGES[/h1]
Made a pass over all abilities used by the vanilla classes to make sure they can be interrupted by abilities like Covering Fire when it makes sense.
[list]
[*] If it's an offensive ability, it can be interrupted, even if it's a free action. 
[*] Neutral abilities can be interrupted if they're not a free action.
[*] Defensive abilities cannot be interrupted. This includes Overwatch.
[*] Exception from this are Specialist's GREMLIN abilities - none of them can be interrupted. Previously, only Capacitor Discharge was interruptible.
[/list]

[h1]CROSS-CLASS ABILITY CHANGES[/h1]
[list]
[*] Faction heroes now will have a much larger variety of XCOM abilities. 
[*] Cross-class abilities for regular soldiers are also somewhat expanded.
[/list]
