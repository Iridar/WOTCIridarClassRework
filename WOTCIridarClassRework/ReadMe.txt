[list]
[*] Bullpups: mag tier crit damage increased to 2, beam tier base damage increased from 6-7 to 7-8.
[*] Ripjack attacks now have 10% base crit chance, same as swords.
[*] Reflex: can trigger once per turn instead of once per mission.
[*] Zero In: now applies to all attacks, including Ripjack attacks and Overwatch shots.
[*] Full Throttle: kills now also reduce cooldown of Grapple by 1.
[*] Combat Presence: can be used during Interrupt, immediately granting an Interrupt action to another soldier.
[*] Whiplash: now has 5 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission. Damage scales from 4 to 8 damage, and can crit for additional 1 to 3 damage depending on Ripjack tier. Robotic units now take ~50% increased base damage compared to organics.
[*] Interrupt: now has 5 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission and does not cost any action points to activate. Multiple units can now interrupt at the same time.
[*] Waylay: now also allows Overwatch shots to crit.
[*] Total Combat: now also grants a grenade-only slot.
[*] Reckoning: cooldown removed, but now action cost scales with distance to the target. Essentially works same as Ranger's Slash, except it doesn't end turn if you still have actions remaining.
[*] Battlelord: now has 5 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission. Fixed bug that allowed it to trigger only once. 
[*] Manual Override: now is a free action with a 5 turn cooldown, when used it immediately resets cooldowns on all other Skirmisher abilities for one turn. Cooldowns are restored on the next turn.
[*] Parkour: now grants a Move action after using Grapple.
[*] New ability: Predator Strike -> executes an adjacent humanoid enemy. If that enemy is ADVENT, you also reveal the closest ADVENT unit in the fog of war until the end of turn.
[*] New ability: Thunder Lance -> use your grapple to launch grenades. Launched grenades have extra range and deal double damage to targets they impact directly.
[*] New ability: Kinetic Armor -> misses grant +2 Ablative HP, up to its own cap of +8 Ablative HP at the same time.
