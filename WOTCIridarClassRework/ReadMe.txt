Required to make Skirmisher Return fire properly interact with Stock upgrade, Holo Targeting and Shredder.

[h1]SKIRMISHER[/h1]

Skirmishers are universally considered to be the weakest faction hero class. Many of their abilities are either useless or broken, and many can be used only once per mission.
Their Bullpups also have poor scaling. So the result is that they have essentially only one viable build, and even that falls off towards the late game significantly.

Summary of the changes: higher tier Bullpups buffed, charge-based abilities switched to cooldowns, broken abilities fixed, inferior abilities buffed, boring and bad abilities reworked. New abilities added.
Ability tree is rearranged into three coherent specializations with different playstyles and sensible progression.
Three new Major-rank abilities added to further improve their late game.
New XCOM abilities added to the random deck.

[b]Hussar[/b] - classic melee Skirmisher gameplay you know and love. High mobility, offensive use of the Grapple and Ripjack.
[b]Judge[/b] - thrives under pressure, can hold a position while showering enemies with reaction attacks.
[b]Tactician[/b] - master of breaking the flow of enemy actions and the ultimate team player.

[h1]CHANGELOG[/h1]
[list]
[*] Bullpups: mag tier crit damage increased to 2, beam tier base damage increased from 6-7 to 7-8.
[*] Ripjack attacks now have 10% base crit chance, same as swords.
[*] Reflex: can trigger once per turn instead of once per mission.
[*] Zero In: reworked, now stacks are granted by all bullpup attacks, including reaction shots, and melee attacks, and stacks gained on the enemy turn (e.g. from Overwatch) last until the end of your following turn.
[*] Full Throttle: kills now also reduce cooldown of Grapple by 1.
[*] Combat Presence: can be used during Interrupt, immediately granting an Interrupt action to another soldier. Can be used during Battlelord, immediately granting a standard action to another soldier.
[*] Whiplash: now has 5 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission. Damage scales from 4 to 8 damage, and can crit for additional 1 to 3 damage depending on Ripjack tier. Robotic units now take ~50% increased base damage compared to organics.
[*] Interrupt: now has 5 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission and does not cost any action points to activate. Multiple units can now interrupt at the same time. Cannot use Interrupt and Battlelord together.
[*] Waylay: reworked. Now it simply gives Overwatch an extra shot and allows to remain on Overwatch upon taking damage.
[*] Return Fire: now included into main ability tree and ignores enemy cover defense.
[*] Total Combat: now also grants a grenade-only slot.
[*] Retribution: now can trigger only once per turn.
[*] Reckoning: cooldown removed, but now action cost scales with distance to the target. Essentially works same as Ranger's Slash, except it doesn't end turn if you still have actions remaining.
[*] Battlelord: now has 5 turn cooldown instead of 1 use per mission. Fixed bug that allowed it to trigger only once. Multiple units can now use Battlelord at the same time. Cannot use Interrupt and Battlelord together.
[*] Manual Override: now is a free action with a 5 turn cooldown, when used it temporarily resets cooldowns on all abilities that cost action points for one turn. Cooldowns are restored on the next turn.
[*] Parkour: now grants a Move action after using Grapple.
[*] New ability: Predator Strike -> executes an adjacent humanoid enemy. If that enemy is ADVENT, you also reveal the closest ADVENT unit in the fog of war until the end of turn.
[*] New ability: Thunder Lance -> use your grapple to launch grenades. Launched grenades have extra range and deal double damage to targets they impact directly.
[*] New ability: Kinetic Armor -> misses grant +2 Ablative HP, up to its own cap of +8 Ablative HP at the same time.

Some changes are inspired by following mods. Not a single line of code or asset was borrowed or copied.

I did copy a few icons from Shiremct's Proficiency mods, with permission.

THE FOLLOWING MODS SHOULD NOT BE USED ALONGSIDE THIS MOD. AT BEST THEY WOULD BE REDUNDANT, AT WORST - INCOMPATIBLE.
