[WOTC] Iridar's Soldier Class Overhaul [BETA]

This mod overhauls the four base game classes, three WOTC classes and SPARKs, by fixing bugs, tweaking balance, reordering ability trees and adding new perks. A few perks are completely replaced or overhauled significantly.

This mod is intended as the go-to mod for fixing all the various issues with vanilla classes, without the need to collect dozens of mods that individually fix small issues. It integrates fixes from a lot of existing mods, making them incompatible or redundant.

In general, the purpose of this mod is to make using vanilla classes more fun, very few things have been nerfed.

[h1]RANGER[/h1]

Vanilla Rangers are already in the great state, but are completely outclassed by Reapers for purposes of scouting. This mod somewhat remedies the situation, and buffs some of the least used abilities. 

I consider Blademaster, Bladestorm and Implacable to be must have abilities for a melee ranger, so I put all of them into the Assault specialization. Both Implacable and Run and Gun are powerful perks, so they're now on the same rank. Deep Cover and Conceal share the same theme of being hard to get, so they're on the same rank. Bladestorm and Untouchable are both powerful perks, so they're on the same rank. 

Overall, you get two clearly different specializations/playstyles: Assault is all about offensive use of the sword. Deep Cover can help get into the position under fire, but Conceal is also a viable pick on the same rank. 

Meanwile, Scout is still the poor man's Reaper, but with its own identity of waiting for the right moment, and then bashing the door in for 1-2 (3 with the consumable concealment item) powerful turns per mission.

Overall, Assault is obviously much stronger, but there's only so much I can do without completely overhauling the class.

[list]
[*] Ability tree rearranged. 
[*] Phantom now additionally reduces detection range in concealment by 50%.
[*] Shadowstrike now actually applies its bonus while concealed instead of against enemies that can't see the Ranger. The bonus is now also provided for the entire turn the concealment was broken, and is now applied to melee attacks in a transparent manner.
[*] Conceal - updated description to mention it can't be used while flanked.
[*] Implacable - updated description to no longer say you can't attack after gaining the bonus Move.
[*] Untouchable - updated description to no longer say you have to get a kill on your turn. Added a flyover and a buff chevron when the Untouchable bonus is gained. 
[*] Rapid Fire - now has a 4 turn cooldown (down from 5). Cooldown is now mentioned in the extended description.
[*] Deep Cover - now makes Hunker Down grant +2 Armor, if Hunker Down is used manually.
[/list]

[h1]SHARPSHOOTER[/h1]

Sharpshooters are functionally fine in vanilla for the most part, but their perk progression is awful. With my rework, key perks are given earlier, and there's a clear gameplay loop of proccing Death From Above, and then using that action point on Hunker Down to boost your accuracy with Aim. Both Aim and Death From Above now have proper interactions with pistol abilities,
which should make the Sniper spec a bit more versatile. I also put Fan Fire earlier in the tree and on the same rank as Deadeye, as both are high damage single target abilities, and Faceoff and Serial are also on the same rank now, which makes way more sense to me than the vanilla layout.

[list]
[*] Ability tree rearranged.
[*] Squadsight - removed hidden crit chance penalty.
[*] Fire Pistol - removed extended description, as it was pointless and confusing.
[*] Return Fire - now preemptive and ignores cover defense bonus.
[*] Deadeye - aim penalty is now flat -20 Aim and damage boost now applies to the total attack's damage.
[*] Death From Above - now triggers once per turn and works with pistols.
[*] Aim - aim bonus now applies to all attacks made this turn.
[*] Serial - added -20 Crit penalty after each kill (vanilla description mentions a crit chance penalty, but it's not implemented in vanilla)
[*] Fan Fire - now ends turn.
[/list]

[h1]GRENADIER[/h1]

Grenadiers are changed the least by the rework. The biggest changes are buffs to Suppression and Demolition, the rest are mostly bugfixes.

[list]
[*] Blast Padding - now applies to environmental damage.
[*] Demolition - now a guaranteed hit and applies Holo Targeting.
[*] Suppression - now preemptively triggers on attacks, ignores cover defense bonus.
[*] Heavy Ordnance - corrected description to no longer mention Battle Scanners.
[*] Chain Shot - aim penalty moved from the first shot to the second one.
[*] Saturation Fire - now applies ammo effects and is more reliable at destroying cover.
[*] Rupture - no longer usable while Disoriented.
[/list]

[h1]SPECIALIST[/h1]

Mostly bugfixes and consistency improvements. Notably, all Protocol abilities no longer end turn.

[list]
[*] Combat Protocol - no longer ends turn.
[*] Revival Protocol - bugfixes, charges changed to 1/2/3.
[*] Haywire Protocol - no longer ends turn.
[*] Scanning Protocol - unlocked camera while targeting. Charges changed to 1/2/3.
[*] Covering Fire - now ignores cover defense bonus.
[*] Threat Assessment - now properly works for Templars. Now also ignores cover defense bonus, but the Covering Fire effect is removed after taking one Overwatch shot.
[*] Ever Vigilant - using Reliable Ever Vigilant is recommended.
[*] Restoration - bugfixes.
[*] Capacitor Discharge - damage now ignores armor.
[/list]

[h1]REAPER[/h1]

Vanilla Reapers are already excellent, so this rework mostly just fills the holes in their ability tree and buffs some of the weaker abilities, as well as improves the clarity of the in-game descriptions for some of the more confusing ones.

[list]
[*] Ability tree reordered.
[*] Shadow, Remote Start, Silent Killer, Needle, Banish - corrected descriptions for clarity.
[*] Soul Harvest - increased Crit Chance boost per kill from 5 to 10 and max Crit Chance boost from 20 to 40. This lets you reach 100% crit at full stacks against flanked enemies if you use either upgraded Superior Laser Sight or Talon Ammo.
[*] Sting - now a guaranteed crit and resets its charge when entering Shadow. Cooldown removed (yes, it had a cooldown despite having only one charge).
[*] Blood Trail - bonus damage now applies to bleeding units.
[*] New ability: Wounding Shot - Fire a shot while in Shadow, causing the target to bleed and reducing their Mobility by 33%. Reveals the Reaper.
[*] New ability: Improvised Silencer - Remove the chance of being revealed on the first shot after entering Shadow.
[*] New ability: Takedown - While in Shadow, deliver a flanking critical strike with a knife, dealing 6 damage. If this attack kills the target, the Reaper is not revealed. Takedown can also be used to silently knock out a group of civilians. One charge, resets when entering Shadow.
[*] New ability: Shadow Rising - Shadow gains an additional charge.
[*] New Ability: Death Dealer - Critical shots against a flanked target while in Shadow will deal double critical damage.
[*] New ability: Makeshift Explosives - Restock one Claymore whenever you enter Shadow.
[/list]

[h1]SKIRMISHER[/h1]

Skirmishers are considered by most to be the weakest faction hero class. Many of their abilities are either useless or broken, and many can be used only once per mission. Their Bullpups also have poor scaling. So the result is that they have essentially only one viable build, and even that falls off towards the late game significantly.

This mod changes Skirmishers somewhat extensively, replacing charges with cooldowns, fixing bugs, improving utility and buffing weak abilities. The three specializations are:
[b]Hussar[/b] - classic melee Skirmisher gameplay you know and love. High mobility, offensive use of the Grapple and Ripjack.
[b]Judge[/b] - thrives under pressure, can hold a position while showering enemies with reaction attacks.
[b]Tactician[/b] - master of breaking the flow of enemy actions and the ultimate team player.

[list]
[*] Ability tree reordered.
[*] Justice - fixed a visual bug that makes the enemy float in the air if it's pulled into high cover and then killed.
[*] Wrath and Justice - now have a special execution animation when killing humanoid enemies.
[*] Reckoning - no longer has a cooldown, but dash attacks (outside blue move range) consume more action points. Now has a proper icon.
[*] Reflex - now triggers once per turn instead of once per mission.
[*] Total Combat - now also grants a Grenade-only slot. Now a cross-class perk, but not available to Grenadiers.
[*] Interrupt - now grants two actions and has a 3 turn cooldown instead of one use per mission. Multiple units can Interrupt together now.
[*] Zero In - now works with melee attacks and grants +20 Crit per attack (up from +10).
[*] Combat Presence - can now be used during Interrupt and Battlelord.
[*] Full Throttle - now also lowers Grapple's cooldown when procs.
[*] Return Fire - now a part of the main ability tree and ignores enemy's Cover defense.
[*] Waylay - corrected description for clarity. Now allows reaction attacks to crit.
[*] Whiplash - now has a 4 turn cooldown instead of one use per mission. Damage values rebalanced. Now pierces armor and can crit.
[*] Manual Override - corrected description to make it clear it's an active ability.
[*] Battlelord - fixed bug that prevented it from triggering more than once. Multiple units can use Battlelord together now. Battlelord and Interrupt cannot be used at the same time.
[*] Parkour - using Grapple now grants a move-only action. Replaces the old effect.
[*] Ripjacks - now have 10% innate chance to crit, same as swords.
[*] Bullpups - mag tier crit damage increased to 2, beam tier base damage increased from 6-7 to 7-8.
[*] New ability: Forward Operator -> immediately gain an extra action when a new group of enemies is revealed. Triggers once per turn.
[*] New ability: Thunder Lance -> Launch grenades with your grappling hook, extending their range by 6 tiles and dealing double damage and bypassing armor on direct impact.
[*] New ability: Tactical Readiness -> using Hunker down grants you an extra action point on your next turn.
[/list]


[h1]TEMPLAR[/h1]

Templars are redesigned from the ground up to resolve their inner conflict with Focus. In vanilla, they have many cool abilities that cost Focus that just never get used, because there are too many reasons to hoard Focus and in general invest into abilities that enhance Rend. 

The new Templar is all about spending Focus, particularly on Volt, which is now a free action, and meant to complement your Rend to keep up the damage output. Many abilities were overhauled to be simpler and with a more clear purpose.

[list]
[*] Ability tree almost entirely redesigned.
[*] Rend - no longer has a chance to knockback/stun/disorient and its damage no longer scales with Focus. New icon.
[*] Templar Focus - having Focus no longer provides passive benefits of any kind, and most abilities no longer have Focus scaling.
[*] Volt - now a free action. Damage rebalanced to 2-3 / 3-4 / 4-5, crits psionic enemies for +2 extra damage. Description now mentions that it ignores armor.
[*] Parry - now is a defensive ability that cannot be interrupted.
[*] Aftershock - no longer stacks with itself.
[*] Amplify - no longer costs Focus to use. Can be used with regular or Momentum action, does not end turn. Now makes target take +33% base damage from the next attack.
[*] Reflect - now requires Parry and works like an empowered version of Parry that costs 1 Focus and a Momentum action to reflect the next attack directed at the Templar. Focus cost is not applied if no attack is reflected. Reflected attack can miss, the chance to hit is equal to Templar's Aim. Enemy cover defense is ignored.
[*] Deflect - now is an active ability. Free action that costs 2 Focus, and allows the Templar to deflect the next attack directed at them. Lasts indefinitely, doesn't stack.
[*] Stun Strike - now is a guaranteed hit and can be interrupted, and instead of disorientation stuns the target.
[*] Invert - now can target both allied and enemy units, no longer costs Focus, and can be used with Momentum actions. 
[*] Void Conduit - now is a free action and always costs 2 Focus and lasts for 1 turn, and no longer deals initial damage. Cooldown removed. New icon.
[*] Ionic Storm - now triggers Momentum and instead of using its own damage values just hits enemies with Volt. Hits twice if used at 2 Focus.
[*] Pillar - removed from the tree due to currently unsolvable bugs with the way it grants cover.
[*] Overcharge, Exchange, Deep Focus, Arc Wave - replaced with new perks that fulfill similar purposes.
[*] Bladestorm - renamed to "Zeal" and is always present in the ability tree (no longer an XCOM row random perk). New icon.
[*] Reaper - removed as possible XCOM row perks. Sort of replaced by Arc Overload.
[*] XCOM row perks - significantly expanded with more fun picks. Fortress removed for the crime of being stupid and OP.
[*] New ability: Soul Shot - a ranged version of Rend that can miss. Has innate bonus of +20 Aim.
[*] New ability: Overdraw (replaces Overcharge) - Rend and Soul Shot always generate a point of Focus, even when they don't kill the target.
[*] New ability: Seal - your abilities mark enemies until the end of turn. If an ally kills a marked enemy, you generate 1 Focus. Triggers once per turn.
[*] New ability: Spectral Stride - activate to allow yourself to walk through obstacles and jump to the top of ledges and structures until the end of turn. 3 turn cooldown. Free action.
[*] New ability: Surge (replaces Arc Wave) - spending Focus charges your shard gauntlets, causing your next Rend or Soul Shot to generate a psionic wave that will hit other enemies near the primary target with Volt.
[*] New ability: Arc Overload - when at maximum Focus, activate to become overloaded until the end of turn. While overloaded, killing an enemy with Volt grants an action point.
[/list]

[h1]SPARK[/h1]
[list]
[*] Bulwark - updated description to mention enemies receive cover too.
[*] Repair - amount repaired now scales with BIT tier. Cures acid and other stuff normally healed by Medikit, though SPARK is immune to it anyway.
[*] Bombard - now shreds 1/2/3 armor.
[*] Sacrifice - integrated Sacrifice Targeting Fix.
[/list]

[h1]ABILITY INTERRUPTION CHANGES[/h1]
Made a pass over all abilities used by the vanilla classes to make sure they can be interrupted by abilities like Covering Fire when it makes sense.
[list]
[*] If it's an offensive ability, it can be interrupted, even if it's a free action. 
[*] Neutral abilities can be interrupted if they're not a free action.
[*] Defensive abilities cannot be interrupted. This includes Overwatch.
[*] Exception from this are Specialist's GREMLIN abilities - none of them can be interrupted. Previously, only Capacitor Discharge was interruptible.
[/list]

[h1]CROSS-CLASS ABILITY CHANGES[/h1]
[list]
[*] Faction heroes now will have a much larger variety of XCOM abilities. 
[*] Cross-class abilities for regular soldiers are also somewhat expanded.
[*] Colonel-rank perks, like Rapid Fire and Saturation Fire, can no longer be cross-class abilities.
[/list]
